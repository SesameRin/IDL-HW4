0,HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STILL FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND KARAOTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUD AND PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPER'D FLOUR FATTEN SAUCE
1,STUFFED IN TO YOU HIS BELLY COUNCIL HIM
2,AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHLES
3,LAH BIRDY AND HE GOOD AND YOUR MIND
4,NOM BUT THEN FRESH NELLIE IS WAITING ON YOU COULD NOT HUSBAND
5,THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLIES FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARING US
6,THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHERE ON ANOTHER RECATION BEGAN TO ONE FOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD A BROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
7,A COLD LOOSTED INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
8,THE CHAOS AND WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
9,AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
10,WELL NOW IT IS I DECLARED YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
11,ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SO DOUBTY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
12,HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MY OLD PITY HER HOLDINGNESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
13,IFEVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
14,HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
15,BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
16,THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATICISM METALUS
17,STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HER AND CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
18,IT WAS STRANGE TO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
19,THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OF FENCE AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEN TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
20,IF A MAN HAD STILL ON A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STILL AN ONLY WHERE THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CRUING A PARTET OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
21,IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
22,HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
23,WHY WAS THE SACRIMENT OF THE OCCURIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SO LAN DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
24,IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLED INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
25,A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND VERGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
26,THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
27,HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
28,THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCIS SAVIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
29,ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEEDS
30,BEARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
31,STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FALL AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOUR
32,HE HAS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APUSAL OF THE INDIES
33,A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCES VAVIOUR
34,THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
35,HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVED MOUNTAINS
36,A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS'S SAVIOUR
37,IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWN A GLOW
38,HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
39,FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP A DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
40,HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BOW WALKING RAPIDLY LESSED HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLED MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRICK AND WAS SAFE
41,THE UNIVERSEITY
42,PRIED AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
43,WHO IS FIT HOUR AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEAT THE EVERLASTING ARMS
44,THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THAT DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
45,SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
46,THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR READ IT BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMESERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
47,ANDRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWEARING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK CATS AND HUMBBBLED TAKE LIGHT COLLARS AND LOOUSTLY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES
48,BRATHERMACARDLE BROTHER CHOV
49,THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CAN TRY HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHARD TRIBUTIVE DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE EXCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
50,IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATON AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
51,IDLE AND IN BITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTAINITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE THEY JUST NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
52,THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CORD
53,WARDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS
54,THEY WERE VOYGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING A HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
55,THE YEAR THAT THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRASSY EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALIED AND WOULD BE GAR AND SITADEL THAN OF ENTRENCH AND MARSHAL RACES
56,AGAIN AGAIN
57,A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
58,HARELA STEPHENOVS HERE COMES THE DATALUS
59,THERE DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS ROOT SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGHHINES STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WEST LUSTRE
60,HE STOOD STILL INDIFFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BACHEL WITH EASY WORDS
61,IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAYING TO SEE THE SIDES OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLANT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
62,STEP THE NO STEADBOLES
63,A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DAINS HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAYS RAPPED CITY
64,YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITION WHOLE BY AN TURNER AND TINQUETTE AND ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
65,THAT UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND YOUR REFRINT TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CIERRISTS
66,BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUREOS CURISTS HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSUPARATED LIGHT A COLOROUS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
67,MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUGE SIDE BY SIDE
68,SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TENT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROP SIR PONDS SO THAT THE PAGGEMENT MIGHT CRYSTALIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
69,DOES THE HEAD OF APPARENT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPOTIOUS US ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
70,THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
71,THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH HIS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH A BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DROWSY IN HER EDGE OF THE MANDABLE
72,FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RANIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK RABIN AS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GRAIN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MENIFUL DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE
73,NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDY THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMON EYES WITH THE OTHER HEWS IT BECOMES SOME HOME MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THEN I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE WHITE PAPER AND THEN I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A LITTLE DAINT
74,BUT IN THIS VEN YET COPIED FROM TURNNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
75,THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON MOST SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOUR CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
76,IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUES AND BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
77,IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
78,DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS N EASY ONE
79,THE LOVE THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY WHAT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
80,THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE IND DEGRATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
81,THAT A STYLE'S RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRINIUS
82,IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORATION IN RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECT PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
83,THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBONE ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN A FAIR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
84,BUT OBSERVED BECAUSE ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRATTING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
85,IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVE LING GAZE AND PROMOTING THE FULLISTY AND PIECE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
86,YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CARTER HIM WITH WHAT'S SCAY IF YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
87,THE COLOROUS SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARKET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN AS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YETST THE QUESTIONESS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND YET SPRINGY AND YET SPRINGY AND YET SPRING ME
88,NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON NEW MORE MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT AND SPIRIT AND A MATTER
89,YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
90,HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY AND GOLDEN NEST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE IN MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST A FACT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE NEST A PYTHAN
91,NOW HE IS ROUGH IO EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL A BEAUTIFUL MIST COME AND GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
92,WHILE THEN LAST HERE IS TURNOUS GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND HE DEFINED HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT IS AND THE ENVELOPMENT OF
93,ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CROWD AND FIRE
94,HE KNOWS THEM BATH
95,THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER A DUDLEY IN THE FLINT
96,IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUT LINE BY EDWARD BURN JONES IN ILLUSTRATION IN THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
97,EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
98,EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH A TURNAL LIFE IN LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AN EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND HE MADE A SCCRIBED AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHOSSER AND HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE ORDER
99,THUS AND TROSSER'S DREAM
100,IN BOTH THESE HIGH NETICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
101,EVERY LION IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGION IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ACTIONS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF WHOLE BINE OR JURY
102,BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHAT TURNAH DREW IT ALL
103,IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NECESSUALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
104,THE CRAPNESS IN THE POVERTY OR ALL INTENDED
105,IT IS A GLEANER BRAIN DOWN HER ONE CHIEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET AT STONES TO TURN
106,THE SINGEST ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
107,SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED COAT
108,IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU YOU DO YOU NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF HEIGHTS FLY FALKINS INSTEAD OF OBEING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVED THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWLF IN THE GEARAGAL
109,ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY ENOUGH MAKING MAY BEES ASPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICK EXCEEDIN
110,HER RANG THE TIEACUM PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
111,AND GORE PAYING PAINFUL TO HEAR
112,HAFE FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDARE
113,HAVIN OUR GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TOO
114,HEDGE A FACE
115,HERREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
116,HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETHTING ON THE RACES
117,HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WEALTHING THE WALK
118,HOT TELL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DULLERS FOR POOR QUARTERS
119,HOW SQUEENING A DOMESTIC UP HEBIL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS AT NEEDS
120,H HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121,HCY WOMAN AND BON TIE
122,TIDE TO A WOMAN
123,HIMPAQURITE A HOARSE DEER
124,THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY CAN BITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FULL WELL DEFITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
125,I ME
126,NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FODEST EARTH REMOVED FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEE AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT OUR
127,THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN NOW ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND A WATER WROUGHT I MUST ATTEND TIMES LEISURE WITH MY OWN RECEIVING NOT BY ELEMENT SO SNOW
128,MY HEART DOFF PLEED THAT THOU IN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERCED WITH CRYSTAL EYES BUT THE DEFENDANT DOTH THAT LEAD AN EYE AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
129,YOU ARE MY OLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE BUT MY STEALED SENSE OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG
130,OH TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SEEING AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKED UP MINE I WILL KNOW IS WHAT WITH HIS GUST IS GREEN AND TO HIS PALATE DOCK PREPARE THE CUP A THOUGHT A CUP A CUP A CUP A THOUGHT A CUP A CUP A THOUGHT OF IT BE POISONED
131,BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWIXT OF OURS IN CHANGE TO TREES OF KINGS TEN SACRED BEAUTY BLONDED THE SHARPEST INTENSE DIVERT STRONG MINES TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY A FEARING OF THE SHARPESTANT'S LESS WHY FEARING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF THE SHARPEST
132,LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROWTH TO THAT WHICH DO DOTH GROW
133,SO I RETURNED REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAINED BY ILL THICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
134,IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS AN AUTOMATEDLY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING OF REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
135,SOME ONE ELDS TOLDS DURING UP PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
136,CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
137,THERE WAS A UNANUMUS OF GROWN AT THIS UNL MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
138,THE STORIES OF THETHIN
139,I WHO WOULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND CLOSED THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FIND IT
140,THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPORTMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THE CHARM TO ME
141,TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH SAN GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
142,HE HOME FIRE AGAIN O WOMAN'AMAN'S
143,SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
144,SHE SENT ME THE PAIN IS IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
145,SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'D EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
146,COC'S HIM SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
147,YOUR LEISURELY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
148,YOU ARE A CUP
149,HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
150,FROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
151,IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY IT ANYBODY WILL STAY IT IN IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY IT ANYBODY WILL STAY IT IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY IT ANYBODY WILL STAY IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
152,CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
153,MISSUS GRUFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED A NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
154,COO WHY'S IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I'D COUNT WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT AND ANY NATURAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE KITTY THEN
155,MUNCHED YOU TELL DOUGLAS
156,FOR OH IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE IT I KNOW WHO'LL SHE WAS
157,LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
158,FOR A DOUBTLESS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH A MAN'S EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE OF THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
159,THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RANGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED AS UP
160,THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
161,HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHAKES INVITED WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ASSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
162,THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK A BALL HIS TIME
163,THEY WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GO DOWN AS GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
164,I DON'T ANTICIPATE
165,SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NO OF US IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY FREELY GREAT LONELINESS
166,HE HAS BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
167,IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
168,IT'S OUT A DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS NAME CONDITION WHICH WAS
169,SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTION TO ME THAT WENT FOR A MOMENT DISPERTANT DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
170,BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
171,HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
172,GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECTED HER PARROT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DISSENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A LESS TO SOUL IN HEAVEN
173,YET THESE THOUGHTS OF ACTIVE HESTERPRIN LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
174,THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GUARD THAT PRECISELY BECAME AT BEST
175,THIS OUTWARD MUTEABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPORTIES OF HER IN HER LIFE
176,HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENT IS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIVING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
177,THEY WERE NOW ELUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PERLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
178,HESTER PRINCE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ARRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDOCIVARITY
179,MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
180,AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
181,IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS BUT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING A SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
182,BEHOLDING IT AS TO WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE HEALTH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO A SHORT HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS LESS IN LOVE AS TO A SHORT
183,BRUTTING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS A VOTE TO SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
184,PERAL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
185,PERL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
186,IF SPOKEN TOO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
187,HAS TO PREIN WET ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HIM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WAS SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WARN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE SWAMMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO
188,ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES AND HELD HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
189,AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND AXS OF STATE
190,THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A MERE CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
191,WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY A KIN TO BLACK
192,IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
193,THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION
194,BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
195,COME THEREFORE AND LET A SLING MUD AT THEM
196,BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DOUGHTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
197,SHE SCREENED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSE THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
198,IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CAPITALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCKO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
199,THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
200,LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORAL HAS TO PRESTIVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONDS SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
201,YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE ALLEGE
202,YOU MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
203,WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRE ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
204,ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PETER TANKERED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECIVE DRAFT OF ALE
205,LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTEST PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST OF PLATE
206,MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK
207,AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
208,PERAL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BODERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMITOUR ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
209,BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO EVERY LINQUISH AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
210,THERE WERE A FEW ROWS BUSHES HOWEVER AN A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SUBTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF METHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO WRIDES THROUGH ARE EARLY ANIMALS SEEDEDED ON THE BACK OF A BALL
211,PERL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROWS AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
212,HE WORE BLUE STOCKINGS BLOOMY PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
213,HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWNED A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW A TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
214,INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HEAD WIDECUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
215,FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF EYES IN WHICH THEY LIVED
216,WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNCIBLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
217,NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
218,AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MONCHINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLKINS THE PATH DIVIDED
219,HE KNEW THAT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
220,ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND UDOV SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD LUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
221,THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPPED
222,OH NOT TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACE WOMAN DRESSED ALL HIM BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
223,I AM MY DEAR AND OLD STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
224,WE HAVE COME FROM A FIRE LULLY A PLACE THAN THIS OH ONLY YOUR PLACE
225,AND YOU MUST BE O'YE O'YE ON LUCKY SHE ADDED
226,OHDO HAD NEVER EAT IN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
227,WE ARE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJOE AND WE STUFF AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST FROM REFRESH OURSELVES
228,THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
229,AND ONE THEN STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROBE ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
230,IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MORE GOAT THE ONCE TO YOU SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
231,YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARK A LOT WHEN THEY WERE SUCCEEDED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE THE WAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBY THE WITCH WHO USED TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICANS TO THE NORTH IN HERE
232,THE FIRST LOT WE TETTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
233,I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAP A MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING NICE AND THEY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
234,I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ABOUT THE LAND OF US
235,YOU SEE I'D LIVED ON MY LIFE WITHOUT NONE HE'D A SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
236,THAT IS ONE REASONOR OJIL THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
237,I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCH WORK GIRL SAID MARVELOCK LAUGHING AT THE BOYS ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
238,BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FROM MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH A HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THEIR MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
239,YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
240,A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SO TOGETHER
241,SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
242,WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE BUNCHKIN'S ARE
243,AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE ARE PRINCESS AUSTIMILY ITS GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
244,I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO IT ALL COVERED AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
245,OH TO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
246,LARGALADE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCH WORKS SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKET USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
247,THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
248,THE HAIR WAS OF BROWNYARNED AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
249,GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF EYES AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
250,NO I FORGOT ON ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
251,WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARILLA LOCK BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS ASSURED TO BECOME IN DEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
252,SHE POURED INTO THE DISACRANITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
253,I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
254,SHE RAN TO HER HUSBANDSIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CABLES FROM THE FIRE
255,THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL A BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH CATTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
256,VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN FISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
257,NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
258,OH JO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
259,HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOXED TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
260,MOST PEOPLE TALKED TOO MUCH SO WEARS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
261,I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WHERE THE CROKEN STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
262,THE VISIT OF AUS WHO USED TO BE A HUMBOGUE NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE HAS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERERS
263,IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
264,I KNOW USE THE MISS ORNAMENTAL STACTUARY IN MY GARDEN
265,DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTER BOXER GETTING TO BE A ELK REMARKED THE MAGICIANS WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
266,ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
267,THE GREAT FULL APPLAUSE OF THE CLARITY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
268,THE EDIC OF MALAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
269,BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTHS THE EMPEROR AMBEBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
270,CONSTAININE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS ORCE WILL OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERITIES MIGHT SAY THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDENATION
271,SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICS OF DIETICLATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLODED BY THE SAME MISCHIEFS WHO WOULD FELT THE HAND OF A PRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
272,THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALL THOSE OF EXULTATION THAT THE APESTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE MISCHIEFS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTENTATION OF GUILT'S AND SKISM AND THAT THE PARROGUTISM OF THE CATHIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERKENED
273,BISHIPS VIRDINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANTS BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE CANION OF THE DOMINETISTS
274,PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DON'TIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN EMINIA THERE'S SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED FISH UPS THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRYMATE
275,SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TAIL THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND DRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
276,THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXAIL AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SETTING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
277,AFTER PRECEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAHOCK I WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATES AND WATCHFUL
278,HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVER IT WITHOUT A TENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VALOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
279,DESTRESSEDING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGOTCH WHO WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
280,YET HERE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SKORE ROOMS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
281,LET US RETREATS OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEEN OR EYES
282,SHEING GUTCH LOOKED AT CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
283,THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
284,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
285,SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK AIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
286,IF A ROCK OR RIVERLET OR BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE I OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
287,EXTING WISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFLES OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWS BY THE HORSES
288,A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET AND CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SECOND FOR HIS PORTION
289,THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
290,THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE OWN COULD POINT IT OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASAN IN THE MOISTILILILVION
291,RUN BACK MONKAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
292,NOT WAS STANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HACKAE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
293,IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACCUTENT PRACTISED INTO LEX WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE IN FAILURE TO HIS OWN
294,IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BABYLUMS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SO MUCH SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BARE SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LADDER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
295,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR IN THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
296,THE INGENIOUS HAWK I WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
297,THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
298,CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
299,COME COME RETURNED HACKA AND CASESING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE HAS ONE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S AS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SON HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
300,THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH AS DECREED
301,I GREATLY MORENED THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
302,THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY THROUGH YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAT MEDIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
303,THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND AN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
304,FOR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINCOLN ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WEARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
305,DEILLIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
306,THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTION TO THE SUPPOSED CONJURE TO ENTER
307,BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF A BANG MAINTAIN THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
308,THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
309,THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
310,IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
311,UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHS
312,THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
313,WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGLES AT THE DOOR THEY CAN'T SIX AND THE SINGERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
314,THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTIS AND THEY OUT STRIPPED THE DEER
315,UNKAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
316,BUT HACK I WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
317,SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
318,WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE AND WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
319,AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
320,MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY IN LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE METAL THAT SO DIRECT AND ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
321,IF YOU'RE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING AN UNCOMPOSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DINE YOUR BED
322,SUCH USE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TEARING HERE
323,BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY AS HE BATTLEED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
324,KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
325,IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS IN TRUSTY FRIENDS
326,HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AND UNWORTH THE ENHEMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
327,THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTICE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT HAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
328,GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT HAS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING A TURITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
329,THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
330,WILL THE HERONS HERE IS GROANS
331,MTHOUGH HE CAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK AS SHAG HE COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFITTED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
332,HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
333,LUCK HIS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
334,I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO AN PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEAR AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
335,I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
336,MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDING OF BAKER STREET
337,WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY ANTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
338,I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
339,I WAS ABSENT MOTHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
340,THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONG TO MY SERVANT BANISTER A MAN WHO WAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
341,THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOME ONE HAD RUMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
342,THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
343,THE AL TURTA WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
344,I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MEET A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
345,A BROKEN TIP OF LAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
346,NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOOR OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SODEST IN IT
347, ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
348,TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
349,DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
350,I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
351,SO IT SEEMS TO ME
352,NOW MISTER SUMBS AT YOUR SPOOSAL
353,ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
354,THAN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTAU WITH HIS NECK CRAN HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
355,THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID ARE LEARNED A GUIDE
356,I'M AFRAID THERE'RE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
357,ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
358,YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
359,THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
360,AS AN MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOMBS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
361,HALONG WITH IT TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
362,THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEES THE NEXT
363,HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THAT
364,MISTER SOBS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
365,COMES HELD OUT A SMALL SHIP WITH THE LETTERS AND END AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
366,WHAT'S AND I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AND IN JUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
367,I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
368,AS HOMES THROUGH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND IN AERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENACY
369,HOMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HULLO WHAT IS THIS
370,HOMPS HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
371,WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
372,I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENT TO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE ON THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
373,AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THE EXAMINATION YES
374,ONE HIGH THEY LIKES TO THROW A SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS

376,MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE HAS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
377,THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MOUSE MY CLAREON
378,I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE HAS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
379,HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
380,BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
381,DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
382,HOW CAME YOUR TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR

391,NO NAME'S PLACE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GIL CRISTORE

395,TO MORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
396,I CAN'T ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED

398,I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTING'S GOOD BYE
399,WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRAANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS

402,WHY BANISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
403,HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
404,MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION

412,HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRUCTION THING HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
413,YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO

467,AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES IN A SHORT FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
468,WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
469,SHE WAS NOT HERSELF UNNOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND OTHERS

480,FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANTERFOOL NOR THAN AS AN SOUTHERN AS ALL ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
481,HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS HANDS ARE AS MUST BE RUINED
482,IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
483,AH THE SWAMP THE COOL SWAMP
484,THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND WHITE AND SLOWLY TO IT FLAME LIKE A SUNWISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM INVERNING WONDER
485,HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND NEW NOT
486,SHE WAS SO STRANGE IN HUMAN A CREATURE
487,THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS
488,THEN OF A SUDDEN THAT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE LOOSE DEAL OF THE EARTH STEAM
489,WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
490,THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DYCK'S A WEEK AGO AND NOW
491,PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
492,HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORWARD SADLY
493,HE SPLASHED TO STEP ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEAR THE RAMPARD OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
494,THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LEGON WAS DRY
495,HE STOOD A MOMENT BE WILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALL OF GREEN THEY TALL WET AND WILLILY
496,THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BULLS
497,FOR ONE LONG MOMENTY PAUSED STUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LAIN DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE
498,HE GAZED ABOUT WITH BLACK AS DAWNISHED
499,HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK IN PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUGA CAN NOW FROM THE LAGOON TO THE GREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND COOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
500,HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPER MOST SO HER
501,THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
502,THE HOPE IN DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
503,UPING THE SICK ROOMS SAW A LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
504,THE NET AND WELL OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DOME SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WITH GNAWLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES IN QUESTION
505,FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR AND HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE HAD SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
506,SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULAS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
507,SHE HAD BEEN BORNE WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN HIS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
508,ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LEGON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
509,THAT CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
510,HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND HOSS A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLOWLY MADE
511,IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PEAL POUTERY LIKEEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SWEAS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANION SHIP WITH THE LIMUSTOWNING SHIP WITH THE LIMBALIME STONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE THREE GABLES THE REDD WITH THE REDDLES
512,THE VUNDOES ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN TAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
513,FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANE BEHIND THE LIVERY BLACKY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
514,A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BEAR ABOIDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOL STAPPED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
515,AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
516,SEVER CLOSED FORCES A PALLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WHITE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
517,AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THEIR LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST SCREK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
518,THEY HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
519,BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS PORING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND THE COW SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHE
520,OR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WHITE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MANY THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERIN TENDANTS OF MISTER GAUBI THE WIDOW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH A LATEST STRUGGLE STAN GOSSIP
521,HETTY SERREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER ANTS BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND WAS MORE FOR UNEMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF FOR USE AND WAS MORE FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HER ANTS AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF FOR USE
522,DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SUREISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
523,THE FAMILY LIKE THIS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIE STAINA MORIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINENESS SIR REFIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA IN MERRY
524,HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH A AIR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LUXURE AS A BERYL ORGAN TAKES APPETUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IF HAD LEFT OFF
525,THE FACT THAT IT WAS TURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDOW US AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLIE THE HOUSEMATE WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
526,TO WHILE APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPORARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT TO SPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL NOTHING TIME
527,SPINNING INDEED
528,I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOW'SNESS
529,WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SKURB UP FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
530,COME THE WALL FOR THE WOODHOUSE INDEED
531,THAT'S WHICH HE'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
532,THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HAD LONGED TO RUIN
533,MISTER O'CLOCKL'S INDEED
534,YOU ARE A RARE AND PURSUITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE MILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
535,MONEY MY YARDS BRIGHT TOLD THESE PUT IT DOWN TO WARN
536,COAL IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
537,SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONY THINGS AWAY
538,MANY ARE I DID LIKE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TOM ME TO SEE THE WIDOWED
539,NO NO NO TOTTY HAD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER I HEARD
540,DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED OF HIS HIS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
541,TODDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND IN A MOUNTAIN OF FAT ON THE NAPRENECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PAID
542,AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TWO AND RACHEL
543,I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SPORTA WAY
544,WHICH HE HAD THAT MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
545,AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEEDING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TALLING THE ISN'T MADE UP
546,BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AND SEDINA
547,MAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
548,WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES A DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE PITZ US HORRID AND CALLS US TO IT
549,I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE AND TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTDY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER
550,I'VE STRONG AS SERVANTS THAT NO EVIL WILL HAVE TO YOU AND MY UNCLE IN THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
551,I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
552,DIRECTION
553,I AM A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
554,BUT THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEM INTO COME IN
555,SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
556,OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
557,I DO I'D IN YOUR KITCHEN
558,POYSER IS NOT A HOME MISSY
559,SAID CAPTAIN NOTIFORN SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
560,NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RUS AT HER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WALL
561,BUT THERE'S FATHER IN BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
562,NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WELD SEND LEAVE A MESSAD YOU ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
563,I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
564,FOR IF IS ANYWHERE IN THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
565,OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
566,BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAT I DO SIR
567,I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
568,I KNOWS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BE IT IT
569,BY THE BYE I'VE NEVER SEE YOU DAIRY AND MUST SEE YOUR DARING MISSUS POYSER
570,THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER NOTE BANDS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE PARENTS OF HER DAIRY
571,OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
572,THE PARAS PLAN LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
573,THE LONDON PLAT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS JERCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS AND THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADA
574,THERE BEST YEARS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
575,THE DINEMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOSE SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VERY IN SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE THE NECESSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONG IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
576,OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING A LECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS AT A SIN HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF AS AN OPPONENT OF AS AN OPPONENT OF AS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT
577,WHY IF WE ERECTATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
578,THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
579,BROUGHT AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE AND THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOTOSIN GRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR THE GATE
580,EVERY THING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIM THAT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
581,FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCETS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
582,IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRE PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD A CHARGE TO RANGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITH IN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT HENT
583,BUT WHAT IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMALITY THE ALTERNATING CURRENTS IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS ANDOUS IDEAL
584,EDITION WAS IN TOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHOTTY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY LIKE LIKE RESPECT TESTS TUBE AND GALIBINOMETER
585,UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTH ER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULAR THAN THOSE VALABLE FOR HIS DINABLE AND LAMP AT A SIMREALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STUDY LIGHT
586,MISTER ADISON WAS A LEADER FAR A HEAD OF THE TIME
587,HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LODE WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATED A VERIFY IT
588,THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUCRECATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED MAY HE THAT AS A MARINE ENGINES STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT THE YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
589,EVISON HAD BEEN STALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN THE YORK ON THE MULTIBLE ART SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MADE INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGH OUT OF THE TREE KIND
590,HE SOON FOR SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER CHARITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
591,THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDDICE INSISTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETATION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF A THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND A GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETENCE TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
592,IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SICK SORE EIGHT LAPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED FOR CONGRATULATION
593,THE STREET CONDUCTORS WHERE OF THE OVERHEAD FULL LINE CONSTRUCTION ADORRANCEDALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY MEDICINE TO BUILD ANY EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
594,MADE WHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WAR SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOTINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN VENNERS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
595,I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDICENCE CONSTRUCTION TO PARDON AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
596,BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIER STATIONATE IN THIS COUNTRY
597,THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESURBISHING HIS UNFINE FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT ASSYNIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
598,THE ARCH LAMP AND STALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBADE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH RACKS OF IT
599,EVISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
600,THERE WAS INFINITE SCAPTICES AND AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER IN VENTERS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT BARTHOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POOTED USE COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECOND USE AND COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED
601,ANDST THE ADISON ELECTRILLATIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
602,THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTRIALITY IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
603,ASSCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM IN ACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
604,THIS STANDARD AT A SIN METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
605,IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUBBY JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTANT TWO OF A LUCRICAL ENGINEERS ALMOST SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THAN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
606,THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVID END BASES
607,IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTION THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ELUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDIC OBED METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE OR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FANNCIAL RESULTS WERE IN VERYABLY SECURED
608,THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
609,HE WADE AT REWAIT THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
610,HE THOUGHT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
611,THE PROBLEM WAS SOUGHT
612,WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL POINT
613,WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
614,HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOT AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SUCH POLLY SPURSED RAPTOROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD RACES FOR ALL TIME
615,EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
616,THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WITH ME YOU MUST BE KINDED TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
617,SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
618,IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE FRANZY FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
619,OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
620,AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPEN SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
621,BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND HAVE JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
622,ASKED BRONZEY WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN
623,NAYL STAY CRIED MAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
624,OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MA'AMMY THAT HER COME
625,IS AN HE SPLENDID PRIDE JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
626,THERE'RE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUSS HE HEAD
627,I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
628,HAST PHRONSIE AN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OF POLLY'S ARM SAT CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
629,YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING PUREIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
630,AH NO CHAP SIR I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
631,THERE CHAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
632,DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER WASN'T HER FAULT
633,D'AM ME AJACULATE AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
634,HOW TO HER MOTHER EVER THAT HER GO
635,SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
636,I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED TO RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
637,HE CRIED AND HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPER'S AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL HIS SUIT HIS FANCY
638,AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD THE BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BIT SOME LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
639,AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
640,IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHNBURKS AND DIED
641,HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
642,FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKERBOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
643,FROM THE GRAVE YARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT THAT DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARM HOUSES THE KILLED AT WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WHEAT AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW THEELS
644,THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MADE IT AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
645,HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW

652,I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES
653,INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
654,THEY THINK YOUR PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A WAY TO SCHOOL AND I'RE SOMETHING
655,THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL CHIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
656,ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL O SAGE OR IN CHEADY THEIR GLOSSY GREEN OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
657,ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXAND TRABERSON
658,THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEHIVES AND THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALLET TREES
659,FRANK RED ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRYER HE GREW
660,MARRY SIGHED
661,A BRISH WIND HAD COME UP BUT BUT WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
662,THE ARCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPING IN THE SUN
663,THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
664,I'LL BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOANED

672,BURRY PICKED CHERRIES AND SAYING SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE TAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR

675,I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW BEND IN STAR

677,HE REACHED OFF AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG EYES RECOVERED BERRIES TIPPED WITH MAINT PINK LIKE LIGHT CORIL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH

690,SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
691,I'D GET TIRED OF SEEING MAN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
692,I WISH YOU'RE WORKED SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
693,THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
694,AND YOU NEVER USE TO BE CROSSED TO ME
695,I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARY
696,BUT EMAIL IF I UNDERSTAND IT ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
697,AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
698,THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USE TO
699,I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
700,I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
701,THAN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES FAR OVER
702,SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA AND BROKE IT ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
703,THE HORIZIT SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT
704,ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEED IT TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING ADDED BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL IS THE NATURE HAS RESUMED IT SWAY
705,YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
706,ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
707,I AM NOT COMPLAINING AT THE RATEEST SLOW BUT THAT THE SEAT IS SO WIDE
708,WE AREUSING TIME IN THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A PULL ON AN UNRAFT
709,HE CALLED THE SEA UPON AND OUR LONG VOICE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
710,THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
711,I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BUY HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
712,SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEVE
713,NOTHING KNEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHIANS
714,BUT THERE'RE SEEN NO REASON A FEAR
715,THE SHADOW OF THE RAT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
716,TRUELY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WIT
717,IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THEY AT LANDY AND WHY NOT
718,THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY IN MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY COME DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOUR SLEEP
719,I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTROUS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
720,I SAW AT THE HAMPERED MUSIC THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
721,I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LADENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PIG HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE ASIDE
722,TOOSTAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
723,DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
724,TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK A WOPE ME
725,THE RAFT WAS HEVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCH DOWN AGAIN AND A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
726,THERE'S A WILL A WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR
727,FIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE RECTILES ROWS THEY WIELD AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED HER EGGS
728,TWO MONSTERS ONLY RECRATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPPED HOUSE OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
729,I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF AT THE ASSUROUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND HIS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
730,IT'S JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING THE NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WOULD NO LESS THAN UNHENDERED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
731,THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH A GREATEST ANIMOSITY
732,SUDDENLY THE ATTTTTTTTIA SORUS AND THE PLEASURE SORES DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WAR PULL EDDING IN THE WATER
733,AS FOR THE IF THE ASSOURUS AS HE RETURNED HER SUBMERING CABIN
734,THE RUINS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
735,THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERROR WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
736,THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARISHED WITH VAPOURS PROVIDED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
737,THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
738,THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS COLUMN
739,FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEASY TUFTED MISS WE YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT CROSSED DOWN UPON THE DANCE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPEAKE AN A PENETRABLE MASS
740,THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED IN SEARCH HARDS WOULD LOOK TRUSTITY
741,THE WHENEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS AS A HUGE RESIVE HORROR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUESTS AND RUSHING STORMS
742,THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
743,THOSE CLOUD SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO QUESTION THE SEA
744,ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALARMON A SAINT HELLS FIRE THE OUTSTRAITS SAIL CATCH IS NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF A LAD
745,BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAP SIZZ IN A MOMENT
746,THAT WILL BE THE SAFEEST NO NO NEVER
747,THE POUND UP VAPOURS CONTENCED IN A WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN A VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACAME LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIST ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRL WHEN
748,HAR AND STIR IS NOT
749,FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THEY ARE CONTINUAL ADMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT THE LECTURERATE MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLLIC EELS THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR HE TO BE SLEPT WITH MOSTSTER FOR A NETHEREMABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSHED THORNS INTO THE AIR
750,I REFERRED OF THE THE MAMMA IT IN A CASE THE FIGURE IS A LITERATED
751,IS THE ATMOSPHEREATE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED DISTENSITY TO BECOME FINAH
752,THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
753,AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
754,EACH OF US IS LAST TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
755,THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
756,THAT SEEMED TO BEAT WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
757,ENODS HIS CONSENT
758,THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF A ZER BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TENT INCH SHOW MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS FOR THE ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
759,HERE IT COMES THERE IT LIVES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THEN'S IT LIGHTLY LEAGUES ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZ HE CORPORABLE
760,WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHED HIS HEARTS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES FOR THIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
761,A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NIGHTAGE HAD FILLED THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FEELS THE LONGS
762,WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
763,AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
764,POOR ALICE
765,IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED THE PAIR WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHES THE DUCHES
766,OH WHAT SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
767,ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
768,AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
769,I'M WHATEVER IF I'D BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
770,I ALMOST TAKE I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
771,I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
772,I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RIGHT
773,HOW CAREFULLY HE SEEMED TO GRINHAM NEEDLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
774,NO I'D MADE IT MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
775,IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUDDING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AKIN DEAR
776,I'M SO VERY TIRED TO BEING ALL THE OWN HERE
777,AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
778,I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AND SHE SWIM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
779,I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWN IN MY OWN TEARS
780,THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING FROM TO BE SURE
781,I AM VERY TIRED A SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MOUSE
782,CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
783,WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF HE'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
784,WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISHED SOME LEADING WORK OF THEUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
785,THE CONDITION AS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LINEN SAID TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER ANNE OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHER IN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER AND MUST BE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
786,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMONSARY ANGULATIONS
787,THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMS SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME A PRESSIVE
788,IT WAS WRITTEN AND LATIN
789,THE WORK HAD TO BE CONVINCED
790,A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY AND GOITIONS
791,MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING IN A DISHIAN OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPOSE ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY RELATIONS FOR INSTANCE
792,IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED LISTIONS IN THE COURSE OF GLATIONS AND ROLL PREPARED THE MAN HE SPOKE FOR THE PRINTER
793,IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
794,BUT THE ASCENCE OF LUTHERS LECTURES IS THERE
795,THE LORD WAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALL SO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOK TOO
796,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
797,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
798,THEY SAID TO THE GLATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
799,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN THE CHRIST
800,POCKING LATER AND AS BENEATH US
801,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
802,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW BRUTRINEHERITICS WOULD THIS OWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
803,AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE OF POSSIBLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENCE HIS APESTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
804,AS THE AMBASSADRA OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FIRST PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXULT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
805,POL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PHRASE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
806,PALL AND A PARCEL NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
807,YOU HAVE HE CALLED MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS IN A POSALS
808,PALL THE CLEARS OF THE FALSE OF POSSIBLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
809,THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THERE WERE SENT BY OTHERS
810,HE MENTIONS THE APOSSIL'S FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
811,BECOLL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
812,FOR A PERSON OF POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
813,IF SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
814,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS COAL
815,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
816,I KNOW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRINES SET OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
817,THIS IS NO SIMPLE PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
818,AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
819,THE CLASS SEEMED SUPERVOLOUS ON FIRST SIDE
820,THESE PROVERTERS OF THE RIGHTNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SUN AND THE SUN AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
821,IN THIS WHOLE PISTOL PULSE STREETS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
822,BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
823,FIRSE TWO
824,AND ALL THE BREADTH ROOM WHICH ARE WITH THEM
825,THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE OF A FALSE POSENTS
826,ALTHOUGH THE BROTHER AND WITH ME ARE NOT A PARSELS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND TEACH AS I DO
827,THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINING THEY GO FOR THE QUESTIONS ARE
828,LORD THEN NOT ENVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES IMPROACH THEIR DOCTRINES TO GONESS PRINCES VISIONS VISIONS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELPLED GOD
829,WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HALF ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
830,NOT ALL THE GOATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
831,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE COMPLETELY
832,THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
833,WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE WHOLE CHURCH EVEN ONLY ANTICRASSED REIGNS THERE
834,SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE A PISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE FIRST THREE
835,GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
836,THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PIECE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PALL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
837,THE GRITTING OF THE APOSTIL IS REFRESION
838,GRACE AND FALLS THE REMISSION OF SENDS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
839,THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERMISSIONSTOCK ROOM
840,EXPERANCE PROOFESS
841,HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PIECE OF GOD WILL
842,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
843,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
844,TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE INTO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
845,HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
846,IMBRACED HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
847,DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH IN THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
848,WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD A PART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
849,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST TO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
850,AT THE SAME TIME POKING FROMS ARE CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
851,THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL STRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
852,TO BESTOW PIECEING GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO WERE LONGED AND CREAT THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
853,OTHERWISE POSIT OF WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PIECE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
854,THE AREIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NO BORN PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
855,NOHAM IT ALSO SPEAK HIGHLY OF CHRIST
856,POSTICKS TO HIS THEM
857,HE NEVER LOSE A SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF AS A PISTLE
858,NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASSIONALMS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
859,NOT FOR CROWN WERE A KINGDOM OR A GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
860,UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSTENCES
861,HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINCE
862,POLYENCERS THE MAN WHO WAS THE IN JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SENSE
863,SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IF STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
864,THIS SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS ARE SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
865,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SOME OF GOD INDICATES THIS
866,THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR A SINS
867,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
868,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN THE SMITHSON
869,THIS PASSAGE THEN THERE IS UP EFFECT THAT ALL MANNER SOLD UNDERSTAND
870,THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION AS SIN AS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES HIM TO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINCE
871,THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
872,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IN COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
873,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
874,HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PURSES TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM A STRONGITY TO FACIDOLOGY IT CONFUSES A RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND ABCHCHCT AND APTACTS IN APTRANNY TO FACILEOGY TO PISTIOLOGITY TO PIA'S AND IS NOT THE SINGISH A RATHER DOES NOT THE SINGISH A RATHER DOES NOT THE SINGISH
875,THE INFLUENCE WHICH STOOD TO ME US HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
876,IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THE STYLEAL THE NEULE PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATEO
877,THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE OTHER TO THE MINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT IT WAS FULLY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECT RISK SICK IN HIM HIS EFFORT REAL EYES IN CONNECTED ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
878,THE RESULT DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATURES ON A TENIOUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF AN EOP PLATTENISTS
879,IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL A WEAR THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BEING TRIBERTED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HIS TREE OF THOUGHT
880,THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBITED OF PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAIL WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN UNREAD AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
881,BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATEAL AND IN SPID THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
882,WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLAITAL WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS UNDIALENTS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF REANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILITIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
883,THE DIALOP IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVILY BODIES AND WITH MAN EARLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
884,WHAT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FINE THIS INTIMMEDIARY WHICH LIES SOME WEIR BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHODICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AND IMPIETY IN RINKING FURIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACEING THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS ANALADLES
885,WITH HER APPLETIS HE ACKNOWLED AS THE PERPETUAL FLUX MIGHT IN EXAGGEROUS HE ASSERTS TO PREDOMINENCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENTS OF THE NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCATABLE OF SUBJOUING MIGHT THE PYTHITRIANS HE SUPPOSEDES THE MYSTERY OF RINES HE SUPPOSEDES THE MYSTERY OF THE
886,MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESIL CREDIT PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED INOTINIUS
887,IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE MUNLATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
888,THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN AND EMALS SPREAD FISHES
889,THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TENIA'S DIFFERENT GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF DEPLATONIC DIALKS
890,BUT PLAITAL HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN A FEATURES OR SOME POLES HIM
891,NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY WERE ARE ART OF THE CONDUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
892,BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
893,IT COULD RIKE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREEN LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRY A PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
894,AND HIS WE FIND A SAME SORT OF CLOSINESS IN THE TENAYERS OF PLATEO WHICH CHARACTERIZES TO FILLS OFFICAL POINT OF LUCRETIOUS
895,THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OF SCURE AND THERE IS A GREAT TREES OF OPPOSITION IN WAR OF REPETITION VANICREURIS AND PLAY TOLS FAIRLY A RIGHTINGS
896,PLACAL HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE TO PERFECT WORK OF OUR
897,SORITIES BEGAN STATINIAUS WITH A SUMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
898,AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
899,AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURNED TO ME AS CITIZEN OF WALCRESS WAR AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIOUS WHOM ALL A VENUS KNOW TO BE SINGULARLY ACCOMPLISHED INTO HER MORTITIES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHEER IN OUR DISCOURSE
900,I WILL IF TO ME AS A PROVES I'LL ROOF
901,LISTEN THEN SOCRITIES TO A TAIL OF SAUCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROUTUS LIKE GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO A GRANDFATHER CRITTIUS AND HE TOLD ME
902,SOME POEMS OF SALLEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
903,AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE PARLOUR SAID THE PERSON WILL MADE TO REMARK
904,THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE IT DESCRIBE THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH ETHINEANIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
905,FOR THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE WAFS OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
906,TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SALLEN HEARD THE STORY
907,BUT IN EACH IT THE TRADITIONS OF HER OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY THOSE STRATIS TRUTH FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
908,THE GENIALITIES WHICH HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN AND ALL SOLEMN ARE A MERE CHILDREN STORY
909,FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHINGS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY OTHER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
910,SALUNG MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE FORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
911,KNINE THOUSAND YEARS HUDDY LAST SINCE SHE FOUND IT YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IT OURS AS I ENALS FOR CORD
912,MANY LAW IS EXIST TO MARVE US WHICH ARE THE COUNTER PART OF YOU ARE US AS THEY WERE IN THE OLD TIME
913,I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND IT SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AS SHALL LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
914,OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CIER TO LAW TOOK INTO PERSON TO WISDOM SO SHE OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THESE OF MEN
915,THE MOST FAIN AS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF AOUENTOUS
916,FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HOWLINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE WOULD PALLED BEING VIGOUR AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
917,THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLELS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT HEART OF THE ATLANTIC OUSHION
918,BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT A TIE BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH LAY MEMORY
919,THAN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TENAYUS WHOSE A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER BOTH SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THEM MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED
920,BUT ALREADY AT POINTED A MECHANIC OF A MC OFLLUTION FAR AND DATING THE REGIONS OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF THE GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORAL LESS LEBRATES SYSTEM
921,THE UTILATIVE CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASS AS A DEREVITY OF GROWTH
922,SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT TO CONSUMPTION ERECTED TO THE OWN CONFIDENT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
923,WITH A FURTHER ADVONSE AND CULTURE THIS TO BE A CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORAL LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WOULD HAVE BE THE THE THERACTICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TOBU OR AN ARCH OF CONVENTIONALITY A FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSTUMPTIONAL SCHEME OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEMEM OF CONSUMPTIONAL SCHEMEMPTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSTIONAL SCHEMEM OF CONSTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSTIONAL SCHEME OF
924,IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEGORIES AND THE COMFITS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE LEISURE CLASS
925,UNDER THE TOBOO'S SETIN VICTIALS AND MOPT ECLURITY CERTAIN BEVORAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR COSTS
926,GRENKENESS AND THE OTHER PEASANTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STEAMMENTS THAT ATTEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNEARIFIC AS BEING A MOCK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATEUS OF THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO FOR IT THE INDOTIONS
927,IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY A SPEECH AS A SYNINIM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
928,THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUCENCE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE CONFIDENT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
929,WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE COOTHICATIONS AS THE PATRICAL TRADITION AS GRADUAL WEAKENED THE GENERAL ROOTS FELL TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WEMEN SHOULD CONCEIVE ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
930,THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARFERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS ROOM BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTIONS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS AND SUBSTANTIAL
931,THE CUSTOM OF TESTIVE GOVERNINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF COME THEITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES OR PRESENT IN THE LATE TO DEVELOPMENT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SO MOTICS
932,THERE IS A MORAL OR LESS LEBROT SYSTEM OF RANKING GREATS
933,THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITIONS OF WEALTH AND THE CONSIDENT INHERITANCE OF TENDIVITY
934,MANY OF THESE A PHILIP A GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE ART THE SAME TIME MISS SEMIN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM A SCARCE LITTLE OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BERATED AS MY CAREOUS CONSUMUS
935,SOME MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HUNG OR SON OF THE PATRONS MAY BE CLASSED AS BY CURIOUS CONSUMITH WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
936,MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHERASTROPRACY OF MYSTICALLY HAVING TURN ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS A MOR OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF MY CARE IS CONSUMA IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
937,THE WEARING OF UNIFORNS SO LIVERIES EMPISIC AND SITUABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MOCK OF SAVAGE YOU WE ARE A SENSIBLE
938,THE WEARERS OF UNIFUSEN LIVERIES MAY BE REFRESFUL DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SAVINE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNO
939,BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
940,SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT TO FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ALMS AND EQUUTRAMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASS THE SUSTENSIBLY PETITRANE PORTENTS
941,ANEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MEANING OF SUBSTING QUESTION HAS TO ADARICALLY WITH A PRIME REAL MEASURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING IN HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES ARE REFICTED ON AIFIC CHARACTER
942,THE LIVERY BECOMES ABNOXIOUS TO ME THE OLD WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
943,IN A GENERAL WAIT THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NO CONSISTENCY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
944,THE DEPENDENT TO WAS FIRST DELEGICTED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN A LATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUE TO SARCUSMARILY PERFORMED GRADUAL IN ARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LOST
945,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF THY TERRACE MEASURE IN CONSUMPTION DEV ALL UPON THE WIFE ALONE
946,IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE LESSON CULTURE THIS POINT IS IT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOW AMID OF CUS
947,IF BEAUTY WILL COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORALISTS FOR TRUE TO SECOND STANDS IF THERE THEY MUST BECHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMAND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF VOICE HAD EFIT
948,THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO TENDERS SOMETHING IN THIS THERYCTION AND INDEED HE COME ANDLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE AMONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMPS THE MAN AND PEASANTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUAL SEAS TO CONCEUM VALLEY BOGUIDS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTENCY THE SOLE EXPONARY DECENCY
949,VERY MUCH OF SQUALER AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNARY DECENCY PUT AWAY
950,THERE IS NO CLASSEN NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELDED SO OBJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEAT
951,THE QUESTIONESS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRE TO AFFECT
952,EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE ARENIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
953,THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
954,IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF A DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE ARCHS OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY CONSPEAK HIS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
955,IT IS ALSO A NOTICE OF THE SUBSEBILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONDUCT OF THE INDIVIDUALIES WIDEST AND THE NOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
956,COME SOME SOON BECOMES A LARGE ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY ON IN THE COUNTRY
957,AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SABINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NABOTOTOT GUSIP'S SUFFICIENT TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PEP AS OF PECUNARY REPUTE
958,THE RESULT TO THE GREAT ABILITY OF THE NEIGHBOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
959,UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTEDNESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPEAKIOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNARY EMILATION PRETE EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSETTES SET
960,BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PACETTE THE STOP AND CAME TOLD A RANK FAIRMA TO BOTH WASTEFUL CONCEPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS IT ERECT EXPON INTO WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COARSE I PEACEFUL COUACHER
961,ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ALMOST EVER IS OF HUMAN USE
962,A RECONCIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFICTING WERE CLIMMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIA NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATION HAVE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIES OBJECT OF AMELIRATION AND MOTITED IN THEIR OFFICIAL SILENT IS THE EFFECTUAL SILENT TITLE
963,THE SILENT FEATURES OF THESE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SAD AS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
964,THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPEAK HIS EXPENITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SIR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RENDS THE OBVIOUS INVICATION THAT IN ORDER TO AFFECTUALLY MEN THE CONSEUM IS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENETURE OF SUPERFLUTIES
965,AS USE IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY A LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AND UNDER TONE OF DEPRECATION
966,THE USE OF THE WOOD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE UNSULT BY THE CONSUMOUR UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSTIGUES WASTED
967,BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TEM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLISED THAT PRECATION OF WHAT HIS CHARACTER
968,INSTRUKED ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICIOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS HIS INCAIRT ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIGIOUS PECUNARY COMPAIRSON
969,AND OUGHT TO GAM MAY BE USED FLIM WAISTFUL BOTH AND ITSITILITY TO THE CONSEIL REMADE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTED IN THE MOST VERY PROPORTIONS
970,AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
971,WHERE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
972,WHERE WE TO BE DIVIDED
973,SHURLEY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING A OTHER TWO WELL OF LOSING SAID OF THE CREATOR AND I DON'T YOU OF THE CREATURE
974,WE IS TO DISPUTE ABOUT PARTICS HER RELIGION
975,SHE A TORERING CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN HER HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT IN RADICALISM
976,HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
977,HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY AND TALKING THE BROADEST YORKTURE
978,AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICLES IN DESCENTORS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONORED
979,JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SODY
980,I'M NOT DEPRECIATING AT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
981,BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSOL YOUR UNHAPPINESS
982,YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PARALL IN IT FOR HER
983,THE MORE AS SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
984,TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
985,BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS SURRENDER IT CAN DO SUCH TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD

993,I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCIPATION AND EXENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE MY PURSUITS
994,I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SOWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRIED TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S A PROVBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PREVISION

1004,IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
1005,I WAS SILVER RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS TO THE INSTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
1006,MY EYES FILL TEARS WHEN I CAN TRUST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WONDERING HIM IN THOUGHT INDEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER OBTAIN
1007,IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCE THEY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
1008,AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JOLVA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HARDLY WRONG
1009,THE CHRISTMAS HOLITIES CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPENDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED THAT MORE OR LESS
1010,INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTER'S NOTE PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
1011,SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME AIR AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARK ANNOY AND SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROAN'S ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSERBY
1012,ENFORTUNATELY THE FACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
1013,HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THE OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT
1014,AFTER THIS DISAPPORTIN I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
1015,I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
1016,A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BROADTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSUREWOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGISH SHOP IN HALL WORSE IN FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENCES THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTOROUS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A FRIEND IN MANY A FRIEND IN MANY A FRIEND OF TRIAL AND SADNESS IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN MANY A FRIEND IN MANY A FRIEND IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN MANY A FRIEND IN MANY A FRIEND IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLD TRIALTY'S FRONTS FRONTS FRONTS ROUND TRIALTY'
1017,TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
1018,HERE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPONENT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
1019,THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
1020,TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NOT OTHER SHE TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
1021,AT TETIME THERE WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT TO WAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
1022,SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
1023,BUT ANNE HAD BEGAN TO SOVERERA JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WASHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
1024,STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPRIGHTED MISS DUBBYU FOR HER FANCY INDIFFERENCE TO ENSET OF HEALTH
1025,STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WOULD SO FULL OF SET AND PANGS OF FEAR
1026,I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
1027,TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
1028,WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITABLY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AND A LUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
1029,IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEYKANTY AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
1030,MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR BY A PENNEXIATION OF THE WORD SCOVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS
1031,HER FACE WAS IN A NIGMA PWARD INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMITED ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
1032,SYLVIO WAS THE ADERATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMITIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIABLE FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMITIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSTRERITY
1033,SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED IN HIS PERIOD OR TO THE ACTICAL SISTERS ALL THOSE SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARE AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED IN ITS PERIORITY THEY WERE ASSUMED ANY PRIDE OR A SOON IN ITS PERIORITY THEY WERE A SOON IN ITS PERIORITY THEY WERE A SOON MANY PRIDE OR A SOON MANY PRIDE OR A SOON MANY PRIDE OR A SOON MANY PRIDE OR A SOON THAN ITS PERIARD
1034,TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARIVAL AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
1035,SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINTS OF ER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHAARING THE ANTICRICHIAN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND AT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF GOOD CHRISTIAN AND AT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS SHEWAMAN AND AT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF
1036,YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOL YOURSELF FOR THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
1037,I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
1038,I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE EVEN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
1039,I SHALL CALL YOU A FREE
1040,YOU TELL ME A GREAT HONOR
1041,YES GO AND GET ME CHANGED FUR A LI I HAVE IT SIR
1042,ATCHEL SERVICE SIR
1043,MADAME WAS SUL BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES

1045,I SIT DOWN IN A SMALL TABLE A WHATOR COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
1046,I TELL TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
1047,THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE CORD THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFICE TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
1048,I THINK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
1049,I ADDRESS HIM IN A TALION AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
1050,MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PURPOSE MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT TRY HER
1051,I SEE A CROWD AND ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL IN LOOKING UP
1052,IS THERE KNOCKED A ALREADY IN EVERYWHERE
1053,YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYOS THE MOST EXACT
1054,THAT IS TRUE BAD OAKCREE
1055,ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FELT
1056,IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST FREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SUSBET CAT
1057,IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
1058,BUT TO HOW DID SHE MANAGED HER RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
1059,SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HURST ENOUGH FELT AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNGER OF WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HURST SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
1060,YOU ARE NOW AND THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVED THE WELLCO OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENT PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FULLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT
1061,LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH
1062,IT SEEMS TO MEAN I REPLIED AT SUCH A PROVAL SUCH RADIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOODED CETERA IS RATHER APPROVE OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT A FRIENDABLE
1063,WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT FEEV A NORAIS
1064,SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
1065,WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AND MY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
1066,HE HIMSELF RECITE AT THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
1067,OR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
1068,I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPLE OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRIEND LANGUAGE
1069,I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INACATIAL AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I HAVE NOT WRITTEN ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
1070,I RESIDE IN THE MATHET GREW DENT HIS PORT
1071,I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRANCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU AND SATIABLE
1072,HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL IT GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WITH CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REBARTES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEN HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
1073,HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
1074,ON THE SIX OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND MUST TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
1075,ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AND INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITIONS
1076,IN SET OF BUT SIX REGULARLY ETHERELY ETHERETED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGAN AS I SHOULD NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
1077,IN PLACE HEAVIC SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST QUARTER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONWEGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED OR IN ICE WORDS EACHWARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTED ORGANIZATIONS
1078,THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELETES INTO ONE PLACE PROVINCE THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGLING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH A BROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
1079,NEVERTHELESS OF THE MUSTER SEAT AMONG THIS SMALLEST OF ALL SEATS HESITATE THEIR PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PRETCTIONS AND THIS SWEATS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY ARTIST FACTION TO EVERY ARTIST FACTION
1080,THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SOME NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSECILATING TO BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
1081,THE BOOKAL MOMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TO WORK THIS DARK SKIN REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF WARMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS
1082,IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY'S NIGHTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF WOMAN STRIKING A AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
1083,THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURLIN DOIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LIGHT ERIE IN HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
1084,TO THE SERVANT LADDERDAY SIGHT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
1085,SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES AND MISERY A DEPENDENCE JACKS AND COUNTING BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISERIANS
1086,THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBOURNT THE BUU BOX AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED WARMONED HAYTER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE METIFHES HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTION
1087,THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN STEADILY CHRONICAL BY HUMAN SCRABE
1088,MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES SOME SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES AND CALLED WELL COUNTY THEY WERE IN THITING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
1089,A SMALL SETTLE THAT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MOREMAN FAMILIES ON CHALK CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPPELERS AND BUTCHERRED A SCORE
1090,BE IT SAID TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY ALERT ITS TRUCICIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DISSIPATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
1091,OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT IF PICTURE THE GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
1092,AMERIC AND SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE COMPOTENCES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THAT FILLED LAW HUNTED AND HOW TO LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A RAILED DECREE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF THESE IN THE YET SHALL NOT THAT
1093,WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS AT THE MORMONS
1094,AS THE SAPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST AT THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISERIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE TWENTY ARGUS MARCH IN SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
1095,IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB ATE BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISERY WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN SIGHTING TWO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND REVENGE
1096,THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT HIM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
1097,BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
1098,IT WAS THROUGH FLOIDS HAD VITES THAT HE CANN'T ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH AUTINCIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TWO REPRESS ENELENGED IN FRONT HOUR MILLION WHICH HAD FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE ENTRANCE OF THIS CASSIONISTS
1099,MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD TO HAVE WISHED
1100,ALREADY IN NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHEN NOT SET A POSSIBLE WEST
1101,THEY KNEW NO NORTH DO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TOO WITCH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE SLOWLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THE COUNTRIES NEED
1102,WHAT THE LATTER NICATES CONSEILESTIAL MARRIAGE HIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SO LESSIAL MARRIAGE PARALITY OF WISE WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
1103,WE BELIEVE IN A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER A WITHATURE STATES SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SAINT DEFIED IT AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE UNDER OF PARROTAN CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
1104,IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY A LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS OF ONE NI I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE IT MADE TO PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN HIS HELD WAR PRECIOUS THAT AMONG THE BLESS
1105,AT THE INSECTION OF BORREL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LONG NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
1106,IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS A NIGHT WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING POOR MARRIAGE AND AS HAVE BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE AT LAY FOR MANY YEARS HAD DEAD LETTER
1107,THENERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES AT TURNNIES IN UTIL WHO WERE NOT WARMANDS MORE LOVERS OF WOMANISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN TO PLATES OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
1108,THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGE MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMAL PEADY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONANT AND A FIN OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE OF PRESENT FROM LIFE I FROM MANY TERMS OF IMMENSE NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURTS POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCE OF DOLLARS

1110,THE PEOPLE CONTESTSED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONCONTUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
1111,THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY WILL THE REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND AS SHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED WE THE STATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE WARMAN CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NASTHS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SEIVER AND THE COURTS WERE SE

1400,AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED DURING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY A PIECE OF GREEN FELT

1403,MISSUS HARM AND THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A CANARY BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER OF RESADE MOST TO THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH A REST OF HIS OWNIENCE
1404,THE FACE OF THE MOHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WINA WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NURSING MEELS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY A ITS EXERTIONS

1406,THANKED OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS
1407,HE SEEMED BORNE TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
1408,IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
1409,WE DON'T SPEND HOPS AS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THE SERVANT ACT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN A SPINNING TOPS
1410,ONCE AN ACTIONLY WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
1411,SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING AND NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
1412,NO CATHEDRAL AND EVEN BURGOES ITSELF COULD VINE WITH A CHURCH AT MONARCHA
1413,BENS OFSE MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND HIS DAYS IN HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANT AXIORS BESIEGED WITH THE SCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARE UNDISTIBLE OF A PARISION
1414,WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHT CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVICE ZVERVODAK
1415,THE BOND OF UNION THUS AFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEEN ZUICE ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY TO KIND ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
1416,AM I HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN CYCLIPITIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANIC DOD SOME TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHEDLESS
1417,THUS AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVANT DAK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
1418,IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAN A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVACTITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
1419,EXCLAIMED SERVANT DAK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELEISCOPE
1420,SHE IS UNDER SAILED THAT SHE IS COUNT TO A SHAFT'S YOUGHT HE WAS RIGHT
1421,IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FAITALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENTS OF HIS ARRIVAL
1422,HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
1423,THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRINA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEAT WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
1424,SERVE ADACK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE NOPRINA WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PUT IN
1425,A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD ENJOY THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
1426,SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL IN AN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HOMESMEN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOP SAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIBB
1427,CAPTAIN SERVED AT HASTENED TOWARD HIM

1429,NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
1430,NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
1431,ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
1432,FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
1433,TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
1434,SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
1435,YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
1436,MY YOUGHT HIS ACT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRED TO MAKE A TOUR AROUND THE WORLD
1437,THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
1438,BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSIBLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DEBRINUS SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH PETIOUS AND DIFFICULT
1439,IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
1440,A SLIGHT DIMMUNITION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
1441,DOUTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENZUF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
1442,HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUM NAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
1443,AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF THE TENNET WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YOUGHT IN WHICH HE WAS A CUSTOM TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRAISING IN THE MEDIT TORANEAN THE NETA TORANEANETA TORANEANIAN TO REIGNANIAN TO REIGNAN NETA TO REMEDY TO REMORRANEANIAN WATER TO REMEDY CARANEANIAN WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER WATER
1444,THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTIC OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
1445,STEEM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHUNER STARTED EASTWARDS
1446,ALTHOUGH ON THE A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING TO SEE WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMUNIATION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH OF ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARACLE SO BOY IT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF ASSOLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT IT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
1447,FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALTERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
1448,THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTENT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
1449,THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
1450,THAT THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW OR BIT BUT SHE HAS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
1451,AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVANT ACT EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
1452,UNUSHION RAMED SUPREME
1453,ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTH SALUTION WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AJARY AND METROPOLIS
1454,HIS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
1455,WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINANCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
1456,ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
1457,TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AN ESPECIALLY OF THE TEN PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORMED DEPTH OF FROM FORTIFIED FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE ARE INSEGIFICANT
1458,YOU MUST SEE THE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALTERIA AS YOU ENAGITGED
1459,AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND IT DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
1460,ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS A SITUATIONOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT DAIRON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
1461,NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTH

1604,THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME FOR THE CONSENT TO THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
1605,NOR WAS WERE DOFUL LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF WHO SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGGED LOCATED TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
1606,YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LAKE
1607,SAID LORD SHELTERED ADDRESSING ME
1608,HE HAD HIS HAND ON LAKE SHOULDER
1609,THERE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
1610,WHATEVER LORD SHELFFERED SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
1611,BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
1612,AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
1613,I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WILDER CHUCKLING THE KNIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
1614,I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
1615,AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN TO THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELIGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLIGHT AMUSEMENT
1616,I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
1617,WHEREUPON LAKE LEFT QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
1618,AND WILDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY ANNOYSILY THAN THE SHE WORE OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES UNLAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEE TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACKED TO MISSUS DARTHY ONLY UNRESCENTED IT VERY INNOCENTLY UNIENICENTLY BACKED TO MISSUS DARTH
1619,DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON HIGHER OF COUNTRY LIFE

1621,I HAVE HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
1622,OH I KNOW THAT'S BORN BRENDIN
1623,ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LENGTH
1624,MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
1625,AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
1626,BUT TOOK THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
1627,IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED ANY IDEA OF HER
1628,BY THIS TIME LORD CHEALTHERED A MILDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
1629,AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS KING TOWARDS BRAND IN HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
1630,YES SO THEY SAID BUT DOUBT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
1631,IF A FELLOWS BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE HAS BEALS ABOUT AT ONCE
1632,GRAPPED IN'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
1633,I DON'T KNOW I'M CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMAN TO FIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKETOUS MAN IN THIS COUNTY

1637,THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKE IT BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOWS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MUDTLE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
1638,DON'T INSULT ME STANILY BY TALKING OF AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS WARNING
1639,WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNTS
1640,MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I AND TWO DEEP
1641,I'M VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
1642,TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIVELY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUGUES
1643,THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR INVOLVING LEADING FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HURSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP NOW FROM THE LIBERTIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT ACTION
1644,THE FORM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
1645,MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
1646,ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEEDED TO OUT THE STREET
1647,ALL THE FURNITURE BELONG TO OTHER TIMES
1648,I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GO STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
1649,I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
1650,I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY TRUTH
1651,A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
1652,THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC CURSE PLUMS BLACK AND AWFUL
1653,SOMET HOW I A GROWN NERVOUS
1654,A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER A TUMBLE DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONGOUNDEDLY

1657,SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE VUSTLING OF FEMINING TREE BREEZE THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
1658,WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MAN AND BEAR IT BETTER TWO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPPEDS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALLICE
1659,BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRACY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
1660,THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMMER BE GUILING OR SENSES
1661,THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND THOUGHTNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FOR HERSELF

1787,HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SON AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRADDLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERIES
1788,BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
1789,IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HAIR WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER AT THE LITTLE TREE
1790,OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
1791,TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLD CARE AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST OF LIGHT FULL THING IN THE WORLD

1807,THE AXE STRUCK AND DEEP INTO THE VERY PIFF THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG HER'S LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM HIS HOME FROM HIS HOME FROM HIS HOME FROM HIS HOME FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS SPRUNG UP
1808,HE WELL YOU THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
1809,THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
1810,THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
1811,THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOF AS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WHERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
1812,THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
1813,THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
1814,HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
1815,PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
1816,IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY HELP HELP
1817,CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
1818,EANERY
1819,A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FACT AND MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
1820,BUT I SHALL TEAR ONLY ONE STORY
1821,HOMBY DON'T BE FILLED DOWN STAIRS ANNIEH HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
1822,THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
1823,THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVE IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL
1824,I WON'T TREMBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE THIRDRY
1825,AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND INDEED THOUGHT
1826,IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
1827,BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK A CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
1828,WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
1829,AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVEREARY
1830,TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON UNNOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
1831,IT IS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE
1832,HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
1833,IF DON'T THEY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY
1834,SPEAK SQUICK
1835,THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FUR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
1836,I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FUR TREE
1837,THERE'S MANY O ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
1838,THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
1839,I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
1840,AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
1841,SAID THE FUR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF FOR LIGHTED
1842,YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
1843,WHO HE'S HOPE YOU DON'T HE ASKED THE MICE
1844,OH LAID THAT ONE AND SAID THE TREE
1845,IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
1846,DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND PELLOW CANYLONS CAN'T SHOOT HER AN IN MODERN STORIES
1847,NO SAID THE TREE
1848,THEN GOOD BY SAID THE RATSE AND THEY WENT HOME
1849,AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SNEAK LITTLE MY SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
1850,NOW THAT TWO WAS OVER
1851,WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
1852,THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
1853,BUT IT WAS NOT THE FUR TREE THAT THEY MEANTS
1854,IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
1855,THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSOL WAS STILL ON A TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
1856,IN THE CORDYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
1857,AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LINE THERE
1858,THE WOOD FLAMEED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BROWING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO DEEPLY
1859,HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY HAD AN END
1860,CANETH THEM BETH REFRANED FROM TELLING THAT OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORTUNE A CHECK
1861,IT WAS A SERIOUS CRAVEN DEEP MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND ON GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTH THE TERM IN THE STATES PRESENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
1862,I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD BOYER
1863,AND WAS A DELIVER OFFT FROM HIS IMPLIRES TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
1864,BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREADS OF A RESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
1865,HE WAS SO HEARTED IT IN PETTUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
1866,IF THE PROSECUTION WERE IT WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORCH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
1867,BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT OF SUCH AN ORANGE WOULD BE MADE
1868,FAIRE VIEWS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE CALEY TRAIL
1869,THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER

1919,THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SENT THERNAL'S AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY

1945,HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
1946,HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FAR MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY

1956,THEY COUNT HAD TO LOAN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
1957,THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HURASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND

1969,THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLET AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
1970,UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MEAN BEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES

1987,SMUNGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARFANELIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR SYTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISPER BLOOM AND DUST PANT TO THE OUTSHIT
1988,THE LURPER PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM ANY KING SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTON MUCH TO SIMPLY AS DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
1989,OH LET HIM COME A LAW AND SHE URGED DIKE DY LUCK TO SEE HIM ABOUT ABOUT ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
1990,HE MAKES IT SORT OF CAUSEIER

1995,AND MY POCKET MONEY GIVES GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE IT ANY LEFT I WAS USUALLY
1996,THEY SAY A LUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT AS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
1997,WHY IT'S COME LIKE A THICE USUAL THAT BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
1998,IS THEY THE GREATEST GREATEST FOR BEATING TO ODD CORNERS
1999,FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEIRDNESS THEY SEIZED HIM CANDLES AND STREWY THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUTED AWAY IN SO ODD CORNER
2000,WELL AND CONVINCED AT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPEN NOT OR A MEREER THAN A PREM SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
2001,NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANE GOOGE WAS UTTERED SAVED OUT OF WAILING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY UNNODINGLYALITY
2002,I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SALT CATHERINE HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
2003,AH MIRROR SAID A DISTANT VOICE
2004,NO SOUND THE BROKENIST STILLNESS OF THE LIGHT
2005,THE STORY OF A EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SO TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
2006,WHAT WAS THAT
2007,ONE THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
2008,NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
2009,IT DID NOT BEACON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
2010,I WILL TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST AS SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY LYOPONED BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CATHERINE
2011,A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
2012,A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
2013,SET ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZE ETHEL CHAIRS CATHERINE
2014,I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHY I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BY AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
2015,IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW IN LIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
2016,I DO NOT KNOW I AM DASED BE WILL THIRD
2017,BUT THAT IS CAFFERS LIFE
2018,I KNOW HE HOW IT THIS VERY EVENING
2019,I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE LEAP BEEN TOGETHER
2020,WHILE CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND A LOOKED AT IT
2021,I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
2022,A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
2023,I HAD AGAIN TO ACTING OVER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
2024,PORT CHANCE TO CAFFERS DEATH MIGHT SELL HIM IN GOOD STEP
2025,MY TONGUE WERE SEIZED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
2026,MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
2027,MY OVER WROUGHT NERVES YIELDED OUT LAST
2028,FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
2029,THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
2030,TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
2031,BY REASON AND AFFECTION
2032,AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MERRY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT IN WHICH THE TRIDE OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUSTURE
2033,THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER CONFIDENCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFIC
2034,SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
2035,THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REALIZED PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
2036,IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GOING
2037,BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
2038,IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE AWAATED
2039,TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT NOTES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
2040,DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NEIGHBORA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
2041,NOW GILIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DIALS
2042,TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
2043,YOU HAVE COME AND DELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE STYLE TO MAKE ROSILY A VISIT
2044,I AM VERY GLAD
2045,I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND ELEA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
2046,THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
2047,FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAIN UPON THE PEOPS OF WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
2048,THEY WERE NOW PLAIN WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
2049,DELLIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DEVIL AND GROZILY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD THEM
2050,SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY UNTITO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUTIS ROOM TO THE PIAZZA THERE
2051,SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE
2052,PUT THESE PLEASE THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING OF OBSERVING THEM OUT
2053,AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF THIS PLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
2054,NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
2055,THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
2056,THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
2057,VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
2058,WE NOT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE UNREFECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF AUXION IN THE NATURE AND MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND
2059,THE PAIN PRODUCED PLAIN A ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
2060,BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
2061,HE MADE ABOUT SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DONE FOUND IT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ENTERS
2062,HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
2063,NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND AND ENDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALL MOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE
2064,YES WHY NOTTH NOT ANDERS
2065,SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
2066,I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
2067,AND SHE TOOK ANDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
2068,FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
2069,AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLAKES IN LONG ROSE
2070,ON HUGE SILVER PLATERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TORKS AND CAKES AND RED WINES SPARKLED IN GLITTERING THE KANTERS
2071,THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
2072,BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO THEY GET OFF
2073,THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKE TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
2074,HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
2075,WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAINED AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
2076,THAT IS A VERY FINE CAPT YOU HAVE HE SAID
2077,SO IT IS SON ANDERS
2078,AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YORN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
2079,WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
2080,HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
2081,HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
2082,AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
2083,BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ENTERS WAS A STUPID
2084,AND HER FACE GREW RED
2085,BUT HIS MOTHERHOOD IN CLOSE
2086,NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID
2087,IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
2088,AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUID WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THE COURT
2089,AH VERY WELL
2090,LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLD BARE HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF ALL COROND WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTEERS
2091,JOT ABOUT DEER POSTS WHEREUPON SEND EON AND YELLOW RIGHT TOOK THEIR LEAVE
2092,SIRDLY SIR BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
2093,WHAT DO YOU MAN INQUIRED LUICE
2094,HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH HAS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
2095,IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE KING FROWNED
2096,DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLYAL ATTEMPT
2097,NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO MANY
2098,YOUR MAGISTRATES PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
2099,YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
2100,THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS AT KINDLED EVERY VARIETIVE COCATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
2101,THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOYLET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
2102,THE QUEEN HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAYS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
2103,SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PIECE IN ORDER SPURRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
2104,THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A COADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTS
2105,HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAKED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOMES OF SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
2106,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUINED MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SOR ALONG
2107,YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
2108,FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HADN'T GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THAN MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED HIM
2109,YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET
2110,SIR HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SOMEAL OR ZEAL THAT HE IS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
2111,THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
2112,MASSIERE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
2113,THE VALLEY BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
2114,WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUITORED PANTEMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS COMMONATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRELS
2115,DISTAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
2116,BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT AS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
2117,THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCING THE QUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED ARRIVAL
2118,EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DAMED
2119,UPON THIS MADAME DEIGN TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE CONQU OBSERVING
2120,DE'ETH THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
2121,YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
2122,EXPLAIN YOURSELF
2123,I LIVED TO THE GODDESS
2124,THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO
2125,SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHAT SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
2126,THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
2127,A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED HE FOUND IT WAS GREAT
2128,WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
2129,REMAY AND I AM CLEAR YOU THE EVENING IS MOST LOVELY

2156,LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERED OF THE PARK
2157,IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME'S AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
2158,IN THIS WAY THE FED OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FET ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HALL WERE ALL LISTENING
2159,ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED AND BROAD SPLASHES
2160,THE REG ANSWER HAD A CRUSHEDED HEAD OF EAR DECENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINALLY PENCILED AND BLACK AND LIGHT AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTLET RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
2161,HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAUL TOOTH EDGES AND SHARP HOOKS TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
2162,BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING FALLS
2163,BUT SUDDENLY STREET AND SWIFT AS A DIE OF ENCORRENT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
2164,ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
2165,AND WHEN I HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS EYES WILL A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
2166,BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUX OF HIS IN GOOD TO VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT OF THE COURSE OF HIS BEAK HIS FEARS WERE RED EYES OF WAR ONCE MORE APPEARING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT AND SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
2167,IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TO SOON
2168,THE GREAT HALK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO A TREE FROM THE GROUND
2169,THE CAT GROUND SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE AND HER JAWLS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES OF TWO DEVOUR IT
2170,IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRANGE GOT WHEN THE BAFFLED HOOK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
2171,THE HALK ALATED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
2172,LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAEL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITDEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH THE WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL I HAVE THE HOOK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
2173,THE HALK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
2174,ALMOST INSTANTLY REST TO THE TOP
2175,STRAIT WAY THE HOOK BLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
2176,BUT A DISAPPOINT IN THE RAPID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
2177,BUT THE FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FORM OF THESE OF MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
2178,AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALINS WERE NOT HALF A YARDABLE THE FUGITIVES HEAD
2179,WHERE THE WEENESS FOR AN INSTANT SANCT THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASP IN REACH
2180,BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WHICH TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND YOU LEABEABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD AND A CLOUD OF THOME ALL DOOM A HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
2181,THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY AND BECOME AS DOGS DOGS IN PURSUIT AS A WEEZEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
2182,HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS SPEEDING
2183,THE LAST DROPPED FLY AS LUCK WITH HIM IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HUCKS ANGRILY OPEN BEAK LOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
2184,AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
2185,THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE HIM AND APPALLING
2186,AND THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
2187,HE IS A WELL COMFORTABLE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO WERE ALWAYS FOR EACH TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY AFTER MANAGES NOD TO HIM AND HE IS ALLOWED HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO AS IMPOSEION ON THE PRICE OF GULF FALLFALLS
2188,AND SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN ONE OF THE SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
2189,BUT EVEN THE UNSIC SEVERAL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
2190,IT WERE PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
2191,FRINKLY I CANNOT ONLY SAVE

2199,INDEED IT WAS LATION MEAN THE CARED OF HAMMITS TILL A WEEK A CLEVER PLAYER COULD IT TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATTIST'S MEANING
2200,WE MODERN'S HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
2201,IF IT BE GRADION FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT A SOLIL QUEEN OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TAKE THINK HOW MICHELLETH A LITTLE PLEAT BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAGUE
2202,AND SO ONE TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OBVIOUSLY MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NOT COMMITAL OF THAT SORT
2203,THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL A TITION TO ITSELF
2204,AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY TO ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE

2233,THE BOTHEST LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
2234,THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
2235,THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THEIR FREE DAYS GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
2236,FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRED NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE REMARKABLE STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THAT TWO THOUSAND BORDER REFHE AND RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE

2243,OF THE LENTINGS THE MOBBS AND THE MURDEERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND A TRAICIOUS DETAILS
2244,THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALEIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WARNED CANZERS WHICH HAPPILY OR NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED TO BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF OUR BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF WIFE OR OPINION'S SAKE
2245,SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
2246,IT WASN'T FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF IT STAY
2247,THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
2248,ONE AT HIS MALICIA GENERAL'S SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAW WAS AT WARRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TWO SURRENDER THE SHARP RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FOUR LEVIN WORTH
2249,THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING RESERING MILICIA TO ENFORCE CANZ'S LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HEALTH OF FEDERAL TROOPS
2250,SHARE JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS IT SHOULD IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION THAT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP LIPS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE IN SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
2251,LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HIM AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORYAL FISHLS INVOLVED FROM THE BOGUOUS LOSS
2252,TO EMBARRASS THE STAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGMENT SHOULD A WRIT AGAINST THE EXCAVINER ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
2253,THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMON NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
2254,BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE IN SERECTIONESS AND OUTLAWS
2255,FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICATED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPSON SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GIRL OF ENDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PREDITORY
2256,THERE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAYED ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
2257,THE FREASTATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PARLOUR VEINS WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TREATY THHENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRE SIDES
2258,THERE ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
2259,IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFFS JONES AND LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EXCAVINER READER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE CHARITURAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS
2260,FUTNOTE SOME MER TO SHANNON MAKE TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
2261,CRIVE PERSONS WHO HAD LEAST THE FREE STATE HOTEL THEY MAY BE SAW THE VERY AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
2262,TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
2263,HE SUMMON HAPPY DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
2264,HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS AN ERRAND MADE TO ARREST
2265,THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING INDENENCES FIFTY FEET BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STORIES HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FORLGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMPLINATIONS TO THE PUBLIC ONLY FORLOGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMPLICATIONS TO THE PUBLIC
2266,AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN SO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS
2267,TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED
2268,THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE LOOKED INTO THE TOWN
2269,HE PLANITED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANY
2270,HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEATH EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTILFIED O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE SATEAUTELL
2271,ACCICENN WHO HAD BEEN HEARD ANY THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO DANCE BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAIN THEM A POND
2272,THE INNATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON VALSE FOR FIRE TO THE STONE WALLS
2273,IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATY AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSEES FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VENTICATION
2274,THE WHOLE PRECEDING WITH SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SOK ROWS AS TO BRING DISCUSS TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND EXCESSORIES
2275,RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GATHERED A ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LACKSING TO MISERY
2276,IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A ERECT POSITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND A WESTPOINT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO CAN'S A CITY ELEVEN WORTH
2277,HERY WAS PLACE IN THE CUSTITY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE CICKOPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEVIN WORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
2278,CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU UP PISTOL TO OUT PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE
2279,IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINE A COMPANY OF DRAGANS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PROTEST LABOR MEN STILL SLAP THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO THE CAPTAIN IN THE CHARGE OF OFF THE STATES ARMY
2280,THOUGH THROWNING TO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
2281,AMONGOTHER PASSENS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPPIER OF MARCHESTINE SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LUMBERANS THE PASSION TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DEW
2282,WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULTCATED THE NECESSITY OF PROVINTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LIATHER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SATETS TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INSEPPING THE LITER STILL INSISTED
2283,THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO LONG TROSES COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL COALS IN SCOTLAND
2284,FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COURSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELKO WHO LAY AT BIRTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN A SEMBINED TO ATTACK LORD ELKO WHO LAY IT PARIS WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN AIDING OF SIX THOUSAND MEN A SIX THOUSAND MEN A SIX THOUSAND MEN A SIX THOUSAND MEN A SIX THOUSAND MEN
2285,DREDING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONCHRISE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKY OF AROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKY OF ARROWS AGAIN THE MOCKY OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTENED NORTHWS
2286,THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR PERNICICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER A SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSEED HE HERE ALOUD MON TRIES TO ESCAPE HIM
2287,BY QUICK MARCHED USED THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
2288,WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHETHAL MEN AND LOOKED DOGS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTE ROWS FELL SUDDENLY UPON OUR GILES COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THAT HOUSES
2289,THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MON TROSE SEULIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE AN FELICITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS A ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COALS OUR GILE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST IN QUEST IN QUEST IN QUEST IN QUEST IN QUEST INKEST INKIRED
2290,BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH ONE TROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT A FRIGHTENED COVEN ENTERS
2291,HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENTS OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPECUOUS
2292,MON TROWS WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUTE SELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THERE WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR GALLANT NOR THE GALLANT NORED GARDEN ON THE POT OF THEIR GALLANT NORRED GARDEN ON THE POT OF THE GOAT OF THE GOARDISTS
2293,FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPENIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELYLIME
2294,BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANIAL FACES UNBITTING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND THEN WEARILY FACIDATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
2295,THERE THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
2296,VALAR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER HEARING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MINUTEARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF THE FIELD IN CONCERTING THE OFF INCONCERAL PLANS OF THE FIELD IN CONCERTING
2297,HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IN PITEUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
2298,HE PASSED THROUGH HENRY SOME ALBENS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HER OWN HILL
2299,THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ONLY EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION
2300,THEY INFORMED ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEN THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
2301,OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
2302,AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL OUTSIDE THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PART IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID GEDIFIES US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN ORDER AND SAID
2303,ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISCOVENMENT ORDERED THIS SOUND TO BE SOME
2304,THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SUM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
2305,HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
2306,THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITIES OF FALLING MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONE SPREAD HER DIFFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SOUND THE SOMME WHICH THE FORMER HAD COLDFUL
2307,THE PARLIAMENT AND DISGAUTES LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
2308,BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE POTAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
2309,THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT TO BEING PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE POSIT WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND TO PEOPLE WITH HIM THEY MUST OFTEN TO STOP TO HIM AND TWELVE MINUTES
2310,IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANK ON AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHES MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARK WITH TEARS WITH THAT CLAMATIONS AND WITH THAT CLEAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
2311,HIS DEATH IN DISC CONJONTER WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
2312,THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
2313,WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE CENSATIONAL INGREDIENCE BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORALATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
2314,WHETHER NOT DISPRINCIBLE IS LIABLE TO ACCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT I IT IS A PROXIMATELY REPRESENTATE IMPRESSIONS
2315,AND WHAT A SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
2316,THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THIN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A HOLY UNRELL PASSED
2317,ALL THAT I'M DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TEN ABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
2318,THE BEHAVIOURUS TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THAT THE RECORD
2319,HAB IT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOURISTS CONFIDENT THAT THERE HAS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAD BEEN OTHER TIMES
2320,BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN IT OF FRANCE IS WARRANTED
2321,OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST INFUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT HAVE FOLK THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
2322,WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRANCE FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY THAT HURRIEDLY DISTORTED
2323,SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
2324,FIMILITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF TO GREEVES
2325,IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIER PARTS
2326,I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO THE COUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2327,THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORAL LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
2328,IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS AND SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
2329,THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY AS CONCERNED
2330,THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
2331,IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
2332,IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
2333,REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE AND SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
2334,SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
2335,IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN A CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
2336,THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE ABOUT INDUBITABLE DATA AS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2337,WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THAT PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ENALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FEATURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOSE SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE AT MEDIACY
2338,THIS ASSINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
2339,A GRAMIFONED BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS NOT RELATE TO US THE INCONENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRATIFONES AS THEY LIKED TO BELIEVE
2340,I CONSENT TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
2341,THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS IN A PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
2342,SIMONS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLY RE ELECTION DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
2343,THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PASS OCCURRENCE HAS COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASS OCCUR TO PASS OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTION GNALLLEDGE MEMORY
2344,IT IS THIS THAT IS EVENTREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
2345,IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL NO NOT ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
2346,WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEISURE TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
2347,THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FILLING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
2348,A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
2349,RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAT A HABIT OF AN ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEN AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUTITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TOISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TOISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TOISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TOISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN
2350,WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORD
2351,THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY AND ONE SENSE THOUGH ANOTHER IT IS NOT
2352,THERE ARE HOWEVER A SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MY SIGN OF FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
2353,THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCES NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARMAND THE MOST IMPORTANT
2354,THUS IF I RECOGNIZED THE THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MIGHT EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION THE RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE THAT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
2355,OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT AXUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PREMATIVENATIVE BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE THOUGHT WHICH IS UNAVOIDABLE THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMATIVENATIVE AND THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMETORY OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMATIVENATIVE AND THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMATIVENATIVE THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PERMETORY A THOUGHT WHICH IS
2356,I REMAIN THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
2357,AT EITHER CRUST WELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING A JACK IN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR COUNTINGTON OVER REMAINED IN ENGLAND AT MISTER BONNET AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED AND STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RAIDING FOR THE FINAL THE PARTRAGEUR OF MY OLD FRIEND
2358,ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
2359,AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MOOD OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE ASKED TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
2360,I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING AND THIS DISSEQUOR OF THE WORLD
2361,WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE IS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
2362,WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLE AXE SAID MY WIFE
2363,QUITE SATISFIED SAID EITHER
2364,THE LADIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HAR WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC OR ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
2365,NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
2366,THERE'RE MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVERBOUR BEEN
2367,I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTURED AT EYES THE TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
2368,MISSUS NEVERBEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
2369,JAC HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FOUR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EITHER AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
2370,SIRKENINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
2371,I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CREST WELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE UP OR THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
2372,THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME OF BEING PRESIDENT OTHER REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVORED TO BE HAVED MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT A FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
2373,MY WIFE ALMOST FURTHER THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
2374,THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THEY DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
2375,THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THEIR MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
2376,OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NOHERE
2377,BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY ENEMIES BEFORE LAW
2378,OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING HERODS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TYRKS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THARO SUCCESS
2379,WE SAT WITH THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
2380,HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL EITHER NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
2381,WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND I
2382,IN THE DEATH OF WHICH I STRUCK COULD NOT ALAS
2383,WHEN HIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHER'S SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IS SECLUSION WHEN I AND MY DAYS
2384,JACK WOULD BECOME EVEN AS HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
2385,THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT ASLEEP
2386,MISTER NEVERBAND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT THERE CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
2387,YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESINE HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH
2388,IT IS A DUTY SAID I
2389,BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE A STIMAK US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
2390,NOT A DOUBT THE HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
2391,THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER BEEN SAID SIR FERNANDO BROWN
2392,I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLDISH CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE

2427,THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED

2475,HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN A THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT HYAC SOME
